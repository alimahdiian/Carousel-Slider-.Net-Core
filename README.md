# Carousel-Slider-.Net-Core
This is a project based on . Net 5 <br>
It is a carousel slider and shows how to create a slider in .net 5.<br>
The project contains a slider management .This possibility helps us to create , edit and delete a slider using Razor Pages .
Also has shown how to use Asynchronous programming in .Net 5.

I created this because I could not find one anywhere on the net that could handle a complete project(Full-Stack) for slider using Asynchronous programming in .Net 5 at the same time.

For my specific requirements (simple) it worked great. Maybe it can start someone else for creating a complete version.

Use it if you like. Have fun.
